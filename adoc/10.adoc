= Address book - Android Application
:toc:
:icons: font

NOTE: As said in the first chapter, we are not here to take a deep dive into the different targeted platforms.
So, to stay focused on Kotlin multi-platform development, we will provide empty projects, ready to run for each platforms.
Of course, those projects need to be modified.

Starting with *_Android_*, we will be modifying an existing project to use our Kotlin multi-platform library.

== Cloning the starter project

You can find the *_Android_* starter project on https://github.com/romainbsl/mpp-workshop-android-starter[GitHub].

Open a terminal and run the following *Git* command:

.Cloning the starter project
[source,shell script]
----
git clone https://github.com/romainbsl/mpp-workshop-android-starter.git
----

|Now, open the project with _Android Studio_, by clicking on *Open an existing Android Studio project*.
|===

== Configuration

=== Gradle configuration

WARNING: *_Android Studio_* generates the `build.gradle` files, in Groovy, not Kotlin.

NOTE: Here the Gradle configuration as been generated and prepared to avoid any issues.

Normally, you have published your Kotlin multi-platform library on your local Maven repository, with the version `1.0.0`.
So, we just have to add it to the gradle configuration to be able to use our Kotlin multi-platform library as a project dependency.

.app > build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
//...
repositories {
    mavenLocal()
}
//...
----

Then, add the following dependencies to your `build.gradle` into the `app` module

.app > build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
//...
dependencies {
    //...
    implementation 'com.mybusiness:addressbook-common:1.0.0' // <1>
    implementation 'org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-android:1.3.2' // <2>
    //...
}
----
<1> The dependency is named `addressbook-common-android` because we have defined `android` as our target
<2> Provides `Dispatchers.Main` context for Android applications

=== Android Manifest

Our application needs to access a backend API to retrieve the contacts.
This means that the application must have internet privilege, otherwise we will get a permission exception from the *_Android_* system

Go to the file `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permission:

.AndroidManifest.xml
[source,xml]
----
<manifest>
    <!-- ... -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    <!-- ... -->
</manifest>
----

== Displaying the contact list

=== Changing the `RecyclerView` adapter

The most popular way to display items in a list on *_Android_* is using a `RecyclerView`.
We already have defined an adapter for the `RecyclerView`, but we need to configure it.

Go to the Kotlin source file `SimpleItemRecyclerViewAdapter.kt`

Then, remove the class `EmptyContact`, leading to an issue `Unresolved reference: EmptyContact`.

To fix this, change the constructor's second parameter `values`, to be type of `List<Contact>` instead of `List<EmptyContact>`.

.SimpleItemRecyclerViewAdapter.kt
[source,kotlin]
----
class SimpleItemRecyclerViewAdapter(private val parentActivity: ItemListActivity,
                                    private val values: List<Contact>)
----

Afterwards, we need to do two things into this class:

1. Changing the event `onClickListener`, to launch a new activity that will display the details of the clicked contact.
+
Go to the `init` block and change the `View.OnClickListener` lambda:
+
.SimpleItemRecyclerViewAdapter.kt
[source,kotlin]
----
//...
    init {
        onClickListener = View.OnClickListener { v ->
            val contact = v.tag as Contact // <1>
            val intent = Intent(v.context, ItemDetailActivity::class.java).apply { // <2>
                putExtra(ItemDetailFragment.CONTACT_ID, contact.id) // <3>
            }
            v.context.startActivity(intent) // <4>
        }
    }
//...
----
<1> Gets the contact clicked from the `RecyclerView`
<2> Creates a new screen that will be responsible to show the contact's details
<3> Sets the contact's `id` into the extra data of the new screen to be able to get its details
<4> Launches the new screen

2. Overriding the function `onBindViewHolder`, to set the `RecyclerView` item behavior
+
Add the following overriding function into the class `SimpleItemRecyclerViewAdapter`.
This will define the behavior of each items into the `RecyclerView`.
+
.SimpleItemRecyclerViewAdapter.kt
[source,kotlin]
----
override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: ViewHolder, position: Int) {
    val contact = values[position] // <1>

    holder.contentView.text = contact.fullName // <2>

    with(holder.itemView) {
        tag = contact // <3>
        setOnClickListener(onClickListener) // <4>
    }
}
----
<1> Gets the contact for a given `RecyclerView` item's position
<2> Define what is shown into the `RecyclerView` item
<3> Adds the contact as meta data of the `RecyclerView` item
<4> Sets the on click event for the current `RecyclerView` item

=== Calling the common library from the View

We just finished the configuration of our `RecyclerView` adapter, that will help displaying our contact list.
Now, we should be able to call our business logic, defined into our Kotlin multi-platform library,
to give life to our application.

The view that will show the contact list is `ItemListActivity`.
This is the last class that we need to change to display our contact list. Open it.

_Remember the MVP pattern._ We already have wrote the *Model* and the *Presenter* into our Kotlin multi-platform library.
Here we are working on the *view*. So, the view needs to implement the contract that we have defined and needs to be bound to the right presenter.

* Implementing the contract from `ContactList.View`
+
.ItemListActivity.kt
[source,kotlin]
----
class ItemListActivity : AppCompatActivity(), ContactList.View { // <1>
    override fun displayContactList(contactList: List<Contact>) { // <2>
        item_list.adapter = SimpleItemRecyclerViewAdapter(this, contactList) // <3>
    }
}
----
<1> Implements the interface `ContactList.View`, defined into the common library
<2> Implements the function `displayContactList`, defined by the interface
<3> Setting up the `RecyclerView` adapter, by passing the contact list that needs to be displayed on screen
+
Finally, the function `displayContactList` would be called by the presenter when the data will be ready to display.

* Binding the view to the presenter `ContactListPresenter`
+
To bind our view with the presenter, surely we will need to provide a `ContactListPresenter` to `ItemListActivity`, and we must attached them while the view starts.
+
Also, as we want to avoid memory leaks, we have to detach the view from the presenter when the view is destroyed.
+
NOTE: In a real world application, you should manage a state for the presenter to avoid destroying it, when the phone orientation change for example.
+
.ItemListActivity.kt
[source,kotlin]
----
// ...
private val presenter = CommonInjector.contactListPresenter() // <1>
// ...
override fun onStart() {
    super.onStart()
    presenter.attachView(this) // <2>
}
// ...
override fun onDestroy() {
    super.onDestroy()
    presenter.detachView() // <3>
}
----
<1> Retrieves a `ContactListPresenter` instance from the dependency injection object `CommonInjector`.
<2> When the view starts, attach the view to the presenter.
<3> When the view is destroyed, detach the view from the presenter.

=== Running the application

You can run the application onto an *Android Emulator* by clicking the button image:res/run-android.png[run,16] in *Android Studio*.

[cols="^40%,<.^60%a",grid="none",frame="none"]
|===
|image:res/10-2.png[contact list,300]
|Here are the contacts retrieved from our backend API
|===

NOTE: If you are curious and have clicked on an item from the list, you should see that nothing is shown, except static values.
This is our next part, showing the contact's details.

== Displaying the contact's details

In the previous part, we have worked on displaying the contacts into a `RecyclerView`. While configuring this `RecyclerView`,
we have wrote that when clicking onto an item of the list we should run an another view, by passing it the contact `id`.

Now, we are able to change this view by binding it to the presenter `ContactDetailPresenter` and implementing the contract interface `ContactDetail.View`.

The view is divided into two parts, the `ItemDetailActivity` that will handle the state of the view,
and the `ItemDetailFragment` that is responsible on displaying data to the screen.

When the `ItemDetailActivity` is created, it receives the `id` of the contact for which we need to display the details.
As we will be binding the view (`Fragment`) with the presenter, we have to pass this reference to the fragment as well.
For that, we should update the function `onCreate` of `ItemDetailActivity`:

.ItemDetailActivity
[source,kotlin]
----
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    // ...
    if (savedInstanceState == null) {
        val fragment = ItemDetailFragment().apply {
            arguments = Bundle().apply { // <1>
                putString(
                    ItemDetailFragment.CONTACT_ID,
                    intent.getStringExtra(ItemDetailFragment.CONTACT_ID) // <2>
                )
            }
        }
      // ...
    }
}
----
<1> Adds extra data as arguments after creating the new fragment.
<2> Adds the contact `id`, already passed to the `Activity` by the `RecyclerView`.

*Implementing the contract from `ContactDetail.View`*

.ItemDetailFragment
[source,kotlin]
----
class ItemDetailFragment : Fragment() , ContactDetail.View { // <1>
    override fun displayContact(contact: Contact) { // <2>
        val toolbarLayout: CollapsingToolbarLayout? = activity?.toolbar_layout
        if (toolbarLayout != null) toolbarLayout.title = contact.fullName // <3>

        phonesTextView.text = if (contact.phones.isNotEmpty()) { // <4>
            contact.phones.map {
                "${it.type}: ${it.number}"
            }.joinToString (separator = "\n")
        } else "_"

        addressesTextView.text = if (contact.addresses.isNotEmpty()) { // <5>
            contact.addresses.map {
                """
                |${it.type}:${it.street}
                |             ${it.postalCode} ${it.country}
                |             ${it.country}
                """.trimMargin()
            }.joinToString (separator = "\n------------------------------------------------------------\n")
        } else "_"
    }
}
----
<1> Implements the interface `ContactDetail.View`, defined into the common library.
<2> Overrides the function `displayContact`, defined by the interface and called by the presenter.
<3> Displays the contact's name in the header of the screen.
<4> Shows the phone list as a text in the body of the screen.
<5> Shows the address list as a text in the body of the screen.

*Binding the view to the presenter `ContactListPresenter`*

.ItemDetailFragment
[source,kotlin]
----
// ...
private val presenter =CommonInjector.contactDetailPresenter() // <1>
// ...
override fun onCreateView(
    inflater: LayoutInflater, container: ViewGroup?,
    savedInstanceState: Bundle?
): View? {
    presenter.attachView(this) // <2>

    arguments?.let {
        if (it.containsKey(CONTACT_ID)) {
            presenter.getContact(it.getString(CONTACT_ID) as String) // <3>
        }
    }

    return inflater.inflate(R.layout.item_detail, container, false)
}
// ...
override fun onDestroy() {
    super.onDestroy()
    presenter.detachView() // <4>
}
// ...
----
<1> Retrieves a `ContactListPresenter` instance from the dependency injection object `CommonInjector`.
<2> When the view is created, attach it to the presenter.
<3> Calls the presenter to retrieve the contact's details for a given contact `id`. The contact `id` found in the arguments passed at the `Fragment` instantiation.
<4> When the view is destroyed, detach it from the presenter.
