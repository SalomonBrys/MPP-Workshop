= Address book - Web Application
:toc:

In the first chapters of this workshop we have used a Kotlin multi-platform library with pure *_JavaScript_*.
As we attend to prove that we can define a whole architecture with Kotlin/Multiplatform projects,
in this exercise we will be using a trend library, *React*.

Do not worry, you do not need to know about it, we will give you everything to succeed.

== Cloning the starter project

You can find the *_Web Application_* starter project on https://github.com/romainbsl/mpp-workshop-webapp-starter[GitHub].

Open a terminal and run the following *Git* command:

.Cloning the starter project
[source,shell script]
----
git clone https://github.com/romainbsl/mpp-workshop-webapp-starter.git
----

|Now, open the project with any IDE, here we are using https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code].
|===

== Configuration

=== Installing Node/npm and yarn

In order to use the previously cloned *React* project, you need to install *Node/npm* and *yarn*.

NOTE: If you already have them installed, jump to the next section.

* *Node/npm*
- For Linux use the https://github.com/nodesource/distributions[source installer]
- For MacOS or Windows use the https://nodejs.org/en/download/[Node.js installer]

.Check Node and npm versions
[source,shell script]
----
node -v
npm -v
----

* *yarn*

To install yarn follow the guide depending on your OS: https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/.

.Check yarn version
[source,shell script]
----
yarn --version
----

If you want to fully check your configuration, open a terminal and run the following commands:

.Run the React project
[source,shell script]
----
cd mpp-workshop-webapp-starter
yarn install
yarn start
----

Then you should see in your browser something like the following page:
image:res/12-2.png[webapp,500]

TIP: Starting from here, you should not have to restart your web application for every changes you made.
The pages will automatically be reloaded.

=== Copying the generated package as dependency

When we have built our Kotlin multi-platform library, the build task has also generated a *_Node_* module, for a web application.

.Kotlin multi-platform library build directory.
image:res/12-3.png[build directory,250]

To empower our web application with the Kotlin multi-platform library, we need to copy the generated *Node* module into our *React* project.

[cols="<.^45%a,<.^55%a",grid="none",frame="none"]

|image:res/12-6.png[renamed package]
|Then, rename the directory `js` to `addressbook-common`, to distinguish it from other modules.
|===

=== Adding the dependency to the project

We are almost there!

Now we just have to add the module dependency to the *Node* application and install it, before writing the UI.

Open the file `package.json` to add the dependency.

.package.json
[source,json]
----
{
  "name": "contacts",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "addressbook-common": "file:./addressbook-common", // <1>
    "react": "^16.12.0",
    "react-dom": "^16.12.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^5.1.2",
    "react-scripts": "3.2.0",
    "text-encoding": "0.7.0"
  }
}
----
<1> Adds a reference to the manually added Node module `addressbook-common`.

Finally, open a terminal in the directory of the web application  and run the command `yarn install`, you should see something like that:

     $ yarn install
    yarn install v1.19.2
    [1/4] 🔍  Resolving packages...
    [2/4] 🚚  Fetching packages...

    [4/4] 🔨  Building fresh packages...
    success Saved lockfile.
    ✨  Done in 4.16s.

Now let's code our UI!

== Displaying the contact list

Create a new file in `src`, named `ContactList.js`.

We will start by adding some imports and create the React component that will handle the UI for our contact list.

.ContactList.js
[source,js]
----
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'; // <1>
import { Link } from "react-router-dom"; // <1>
import AddressBook from 'addressbook-common/packages/addressbook-common'; // <2>

export default function ContactList() { } // <3>
----
<1> React's dependencies
<2> Our Kotlin multi-platform library dependency
<3> Creates our React component for the contact list

In *_JavaScript_* there is such thing as interface, so we won't be able to implement our contracts.
Instead, we will define a hook (`useEffect(...)`), that will run after that the UI rendering.

Set the presenter and bind it to the view

.ContactList.js
[source,js]
----
export default function ContactList() {
    let [presenter] = useState(() => addressBook.com.mybusiness.di.CommonInjector.contactListPresenter()); // <1>
    let [contacts, setContacts] = useState([]) // <2>

    useEffect(() => {
      presenter.attachView({ // <3>
        displayContactList: function(contacts) { // <4>
          setContacts(contacts.toArray()) // <5>
        }
      });
    }, []);
}
----
<1> Initializes the presenter while the component is created, by calling our manual dependency injection object `CommonInjector`.
<2> Defines a local variable, a list of contacts, and a function to update it. _(default value is an empty array)_
<3> Calls the attachment function of the presenter on an anonymous object, that represents the View
<4> Defines the function `displayContactList` from the `ContactList.View` interface, that is needed by the presenter to update the UI.
<5> Updates the contact list

We now have everything we need to retrieve our contact list from the backend API. It would be nicer to display it on the web page, right ?

At the end of our component, set a return statement, that will handle the content to display on the screen

.ContactList.js
[source]
----
export default function ContactList() {
    // ...
    return (
      <ul>
        {contacts.map(contact => { <1>
          return (
            <li>
                <Link to={`/contact/${contact.id}`}> <2>
                    {contact.fullName}
                </Link>
            </li>)
        })}
      </ul>
    );
}
----
<1> For each contact, display its name and...
<2> ...set a link to go to its detail view.

If you go to the web page, you should see that nothing change. This is because we must use our component inside the `App.js`.

Open the `App.js`, add an import and a usage for the component `ContactList`.

.App.js
[source,js]
----
//...
import ContactList from "./ContactList.js" // <1>

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/">
          <ContactList /> // <2>
        </Route>
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  )
}
// ...
----
<1> Adds the import on the `ContactList` component
<2> Removes the `<h1>` and replace it by the `ContactList` usage

=== Running the application

If you reopen your web page in your browser, you should see something like that:
image:res/12-7.png[contact list,600]

== Displaying the contact's details

We have just wrote that for each contact we show its full name on a list.
That name is clickable, and should lead you to a new page.
If you have clicked on the contacts' names, you may have noticed that nothing showed up.
We are going to make this right.

Create a new file in `src`, named `Contact.js`. It will embed the *React* component that will be responsible
for retrieving the contact's details and display them on the page.

Open the `Contact.js` file and add the following imports, then create the *React* component.

.Contact.js
[source,js]
----
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'; // <1>
import { useParams, Link } from "react-router-dom"; // <1>
import AddressBook from 'addressbook-common/packages/addressbook-common'; // <2>

export default function Contact() { } // <3>
----
<1> React's dependencies
<2> Our Kotlin multi-platform library dependency
<3> Creates our *React* component for the contact list

Set the presenter and bind it to the view

.Contact.js
[source,js]
----
export default function Contact() {
    let { id } = useParams(); // <1>
    let [presenter] = useState(() => AddressBook.com.mybusiness.di.CommonInjector.contactDetailPresenter()); // <2>
    let [contact, setContact] = useState(null) // <3>

    useEffect(() => {
        presenter.attachView({ // <4>
            displayContact: function(c) { // <5>
                setContact(c) // <6>
            }
        });
        presenter.getContact(id); // <7>
    }, []);
}
----
<1> Gets the contact `id`, passed as URL parameter. This will be used for retrieving contact's details from the backend API.
<2> Initializes the presenter while the component is created, by calling our manual dependency injection object `CommonInjector`.
<3> Defines a local variable, a contact, and a function to update it. _(default value is null)_.
<4> Calls the attachment function of the presenter on an anonymous object, that represents the View.
<5> Defines the function `displayContact` from the `ContactDetail.View` interface, that is needed by the presenter to update the UI.
<6> Updates the contact when retrieved from the backend API.
<7> Trigger the API call to get the contact's details.

Let's ho to the end of the component to add the UI that will show our contact's details.

.Contact.js
[source]
----
export default function Contact() {
    // ...
    if (contact == null) return (<p></p>); <1>

    return (<div>
      <p>
          <Link to={`/`}>
              Back to the contact list
          </Link>
      </p>
      <p>First name: {contact.name.firstName}</p> <2>
      <p>Last name: {contact.name.lastName}</p> <2>
      <p>
          Phones:
          <ul>
              {contact.phones.toArray().map(phone => ( <3>
                  <li>
                      {phone.type.displayedName}: {phone.number}
                  </li>
              ))}
          </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
          Addresses:
          <ul>
              {contact.addresses.toArray().map(address => ( <4>
                  <li>
                      {address.type.displayedName}:
                      {address.street} {address.type.displayedName},
                      {address.postalCode} {address.city}, {address.country}
                  </li>
              ))}
          </ul>
      </p>
    </div>)
}
----
<1> If the contact is null, obvisouly nothing is displayed
<2> Prints the full name on the screen
<3> Prints a list of the contact's phones
<4> Prints a list of the contact's addresses

Again, if you tried to get the contact's details, you probably saw that nothing has changed.
This is because we must use our component inside the `App.js`.

Open the `App.js`, add an import and a usage for the `Contact` component.

.App.js
[source,js]
----
//...
import ContactList from "./ContactList.js"
import Contact from "./Contact.js" // <1>

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/contact/:id" children={<Contact />} /> // <2>
        <Route path="/">
          <ContactList />
        </Route>
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  )
}
// ...
----
<1> Adds the import on the `Contact` component
<2> Adds a route for the path `/contact/:id`, that should display to the `Contact` component

== What's next ?

Congratulations!!! You have develop a Kotlin multi-platform library and use it on three different platforms!

However, our journey is not over, yet.
