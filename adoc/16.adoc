== Final thought

You may have noticed that the experience remains different from each platforms for most of the Kotlin/Multiplatform libraries.
But we, at *_https://kodein.net/#/home/en[Kodein Koders]_*, are working on it.

Indeed, *_Kodein-DI_* is just one of the libraries from the *_https://kodein.org/[Kodein Framework]_*
that we are developing to empower Kotlin/Multiplatform projects.
And we want to improve our libraries to make them work seamlessly from every platforms targeted by Kotlin!
