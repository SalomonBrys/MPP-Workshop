== Your first test

To start, we'll write some code that is common to all platform.

First, in `commonMain/kotlin`, let's create a package and a kotlin source file:

[TIP]

Let's write our first multiplatform function:

.functions.kt
[source,kotlin]
----

.functionsTest.kt
[source,kotlin]
----
import com.mybusiness.*
import kotlin.test.*

@Test
fun testSimpleAddition() {

@Test
fun testNegativeAddition() {
    assertEquals(-1, addition(2, -3))
}
