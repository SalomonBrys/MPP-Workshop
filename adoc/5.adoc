Now that we have a working *_Android_* application, we will try, and succeed, the use of our Kotlin multi-platform library on *_iOS_*.

IMPORTANT: You'll be able to fulfill this part only if you have a MacOS computer. Otherwise, consider following up with your neighbor :)

== Project Creation Wizard

By now you should have installed https://developer.apple.com/xcode/[Xcode].
Open it and create a new project:

|Choose the project template:

*Single View App*

|Enter the details of your application:

- Product Name: `iOS Application`
- Organization identifier: `com.mybusiness.ios`
- Language: *_Swift_*
- User Interface: *_SwiftUI_*

|Choose the location of your *_iOS_* project

|Check the good configuration by clicking on image:res/run-ios.png[run ios,32] to run the app
|===

Your *_Xcode_* environment is ready!

== Adding your Kotlin multi-platform library to Xcode

Remember, while we were building our Kotlin multi-platform library, we added a build step named `packForXcode`.
This task should have built and published the `framework` needed by *_Xcode_* to consume our library with *_iOS_* in a specific directory.

.Kotlin multi-platform library build directory.
