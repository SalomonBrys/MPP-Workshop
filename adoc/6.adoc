= Using your multi-platform library on the Web
:toc:
:icons: font

Finally, after running our Kotlin multi-platform library on *_Android_* and *_iOS_*, we only have to make it work on the Web.

To do so, we will create a simple web page project, to run our Kotlin multi-platform library with *_JavaScript_*.

== Project Creation Wizard

For the simplicity of this workshop, we will use *_IntelliJ IDEA Community/Ultimate_* to create our project.

NOTE: The IntelliJ Ultimate Edition have more facilities to create project, so we will see both usage.

Then, you will have a shiny project ready to build your web application :).

In _Community Edition_, you should switch from *Project* view to *Project Files* view by using the above menu

//NOTE: From here, everything will be the same, that you are using IntelliJ Community or Ultimate.

== Running a simple web page

Before reaching our goal to use Kotlin multi-platform code with *_JavaScript_*,
we will build a simple web page and see how to display it into our browser.

To do so, we will create a new *_HTML_* file in our project, and add some *_HTML_* to it.

[cols="^65%,<.^35%a",grid="none",frame="none"]
|===
|image:res/6-8.png[add html file]
|*Right-click* on the project/path, then click on *New* > *HTML File*
|image:res/6-9.png[name html file]
|Name your file: *index.html*
|===

Finally, add the following code to your *index.html*

.index.html
[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Kotlin MPP with JS</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="kotlin_mpp_message">
        Hello multi-platform workshopers!
    </h1>
</body>
</html>
----

[cols="^65%,<.^35%a",grid="none",frame="none"]
|===
|image:res/6-10.png[name html file]
|
Run the page in a browser by clicking on the tooltip bar
in the top right corner of the editor image:res/6-11.png[tooltip,100]
|===

Now we can see our web page.

== Integrating your Kotlin multi-platform library

=== Add the JavaScript modules

Remember, in the Kotlin multi-platform library chapter we have built our project to generate binaries for all our targets, including *_JavaScript_*.
If you go back to this project, and browse the `/build` directory you will find a `js` sub-directory.


[cols="^35%,<.^65%a",grid="none",frame="none"]
|===
|image:res/6-13.png[build js]
|
The files that will need our attention are `business-library.js` and `kotlin.js`.

* `kotlin.js` contains the Kotlin standard library for the *_JavaScript_* platform
* `business-library.js` is our Kotlin multi-platform library, it rely on `kotlin.js`

So, we will need to import both modules in our project.
|===

To import the libraries into our project we can use the command line to copy them, depending on where you have set your projects location.

* On *_Linux_* / *_MacOS_*, open a terminal and run the following command.
+
WARNING: do not forget to change the path of your projects if needed
+
.Create a `/libraries` directory for your web application project.
[source,shell script]
----
mkdir workspace/kotlinconf/webapp/libraries
----
+
.Copy the `kotlin.js` file, from the `/build` directory of the `business-library` project to the `/libraries` directory of your web application project.
[source,shell script]
----
cp workspace/kotlinconf/business-library/build/js/packages_imported/kotlin/1.3.50/kotlin.js workspace/kotlinconf/webapp/libraries
----
+
.Copy the `business-library.js` file.
[source,shell script]
----
cp workspace/kotlinconf/business-library/build/js/packages/business-library/kotlin/business-library.js workspace/kotlinconf/webapp/libraries
----
* On Windows, open a terminal and run the following command.
+
WARNING: do not forget to change the path of your projects if needed
+
.Create a `/libraries` directory for your web application project.
[source,shell script]
----
mkdir C:\workspace\kotlinconf\webapp\libraries
----
+
.Copy the `kotlin.js` file, from the `/build` directory of the `business-library` project to the `/libraries` directory of your web application project.
[source,shell script]
----
copy C:\workspace\kotlinconf\business-library\build\js\packages_imported\kotlin\1.3.50\kotlin.js C:\workspace\kotlinconf\webapp\libraries
----
+
.Copy the `business-library.js` file.
[source,shell script]
----
copy C:\workspace\kotlinconf\business-library\build\js\packages\business-library\kotlin\business-library.js C:\workspace\kotlinconf\webapp\libraries
----

You should now see the libraries in your project's hierarchy:

image:res/6-14.png[project hierarchy,300]

==== What's does our module contain?

If you have been curious, you may have opened `business-library.js` to see what is in it.

.libraries/business-library.js
[source,javascript]
----
(function (root, factory) {
    // ...
    if (typeof kotlin === 'undefined') { // <1>
      throw new Error("Error loading module 'business-library'. Its dependency 'kotlin' was not found. Please, check whether 'kotlin' is loaded prior to 'business-library'.");
    }
    root['business-library'] = factory(typeof this['business-library'] === 'undefined' ? {} : this['business-library'], kotlin); // <2>
}(this, function (_, Kotlin) {
  'use strict';
  var trimIndent = Kotlin.kotlin.text.trimIndent_pdl1vz$;
  function sayHelloKotlinConf() { // <3>
    return trimIndent('\n' + '    Hello KotlinConf, Kotlin/Multiplatform is awesome!' + '\n' + '    We are running on ' + platformName() + '\n' + '    ');
  }
  function platformName() { // <4>
    return 'JavaScript';
  }
  var package$com = _.com || (_.com = {}); // <5>
  var package$mybusiness = package$com.mybusiness || (package$com.mybusiness = {});
  package$mybusiness.sayHelloKotlinConf = sayHelloKotlinConf;
  package$mybusiness.platformName = platformName;
  Kotlin.defineModule('business-library', _);
  return _;
}));
----
<1> Checks if the module `kotlin.js` is present.
<2> Set the module accessible with `this['business-library']` from any *_JavaScript_* code.
<3> Our previously created common function `sayHelloKotlinConf()`.
<4> The *_JavaScript_*  expect function for `platformName()`.
<5> Managing packages, thus we will need to call the full qualified name to reach the module members.

=== Use your Kotlin multi-platform code

To use our Kotlin multi-platform library in our *_HTML_* project we need to reference them. Go to the `index.html` file and add the following script in the `head` of the web page.

.index.html
[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<!-- ... -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="libraries/kotlin.js`"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="libraries/business-library.js"></script>
</head>
<!-- ... -->
</html>
----

IMPORTANT: The order of the script references really matters. As the module `kotlin.js` is referenced in `business-library.js`, it must be declared first.

NOTE: Your web page should work, but nothing will change. However, to see if there is some ongoing issues you can check the console of the developer console of your browser by clicking on the `F12` key on your keyboard.

Now, you can change the `body` of your web page to use the Kotlin multi-platform library.

.index.html
[source,html]
----
<body>
<!-- ... -->
    <h1 id="kotlin_mpp_message">
        Hello multi-platform workshopers !
    </h1>

    <script type="text/javascript"> // <1>
        document.getElementById('kotlin_mpp_message').innerText = // <2>
        this['business-library'].com.mybusiness.sayHelloKotlinConf() // <3>
    </script>
<!-- ... -->
</body>
----
<1> Defining a *_JavaScript_* based script.
<2> Accessing the *h1* `kotlin_mpp_message` to be able to set its _inner text_.
<3> Calling our `sayHelloKotlinConf()` function from the module `business-library`, with its full qualified name.

Now rerun the page in a browser by clicking on the tooltip bar
in the top right corner of the editor image:res/6-11.png[tooltip,100], or by reloading the page that you have already opened in your browser.

image:res/6-15.png[final web page, 720]

Nice! We can see, displayed on the screen:

- the common message: `Hello KotlinConf, Kotlin/Multiplatform is awesome!`
- the *_JavaScript_* specific message: `We are running on JavaScript`

== What's next ?

Now that you know how to work with *_Kotlin/Multiplatform_* we will go further, by building a real case application.
